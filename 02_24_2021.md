### Variables
```bash
# The link under the code block explains what the comment below means: 
#!/bin/bash

# We declared a variable username and assign a string value 'Vivian' to it
# You can name your own variable and try to assign any string value to it
  
username="Vivian"

# We declared a variable age and assign an integer value 25 to it

age=25

# Suppose you want to display the variable or any other value in the terminal,
# you can try the following command

# display a string

echo "Good afternoon, Vivian"

# display a string with a variable
# With this command, you can reference your predeclared variable by its name with a $ sign prefixed to it 

echo "Good afternoon, $username"

# You can try to assign a value derived from a command to a variable and display it

username=$(whoami)
echo $username

currentdate=$(date)
echo $currentdate

# You can combine your variable with some values, for instance:
# The following command gives you the current year
# This is called parameter expansion

year=$(date +%Y)
newyear=${year}_this_is_a_tail
echo $newyear

### Numeric and String Comparisons
|Description|Numeric Comparison|String Comparison|
|-----|-----|-----|
|less than|-lt|<|
|greater than|-gt|>|
|equal|-eq|=|
|not equal|-ne|!=|
|less or equal|-le|N/A|
|greater or equal|-ge|N/A|
|Shell comparison example|[100 eq 50]; echo $?|["Vivian" = "Rabbit"]; echo $?|

We use square brackets `[]` to perform evaluation of numeric and string comparisons.


Using `echo $?` to check the returned value from the previously executed evaluation.


There are two possible outcomes for every evaluation, `true` or `false`.


If the returned value is equal to `0`, then the comparison evaluation is `true`.
If the returned value is equal to `1`, then the comparison evaluation is `false`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

string_a="Vivian"
string_b="Rabbit"

echo "Is $string_a a $string_b?"
[ $string_a = $string_b ]
echo $?

# notice
# [ $string_a = $string_b ] works
# [ $string_a=$string_b ] works
# [$string_a = $string_b] won't work

num_a=50
num_b=100
echo "Is $num_a less than $num_b?"
[ $num_a -lt $num_b ]
echo $?
```

### Conditional Statements
Say, for example, we would like to execute commands based on different conditions.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
num_a=50
num_b=100

if [ $num_a -lt $num_b ]; then
  echo "$num_a is less than $num_b"
fi

# You can add an alternative statement if the condition is evaluated to false

if [ $num_a -lt $num_b ]; then
  echo "$num_a is less than $num_b"
  echo "Evaluation ends."
# More commands can be added in this block
else
  echo "$num_a is greater than $num_b"
fi

# Application - test if a file exists
FILENAME="$1"

echo "Searching for $FILENAME..."
if [ -f $FILENAME ]; then
  echo "The absolute path of $FILENAME is:"
  echo "$(pwd)/${FILENAME}"
else
  echo "File does not exist." 
fi

```

### Loops
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# for-loop
# The code block between do and done will be executed repeatedly for each value the list has
# The list of the following example is 1 2 3. So the echo command will be executed triple times and 1,2 and 3 will be printed.

for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo $i
done

# while-loop
# If the condition is evaluated to true, the code block between do and done will be executed. Otherwise, nothing happens.
# a+=1 is identical to a = a + 1, which means incrementing a by 1 and assign the result back to a

counter=0
while [ $counter -lt 5 ]; do
  let counter+=1
  echo $counter
done

# until-loop
# The code block between do and done will be executed repeatedly until the condition changes from false to true
# When the counter is less than 3, the code block will not be executed any more.
# a-=1 is identical to a = a - 1, which means decrementing a by 1 and assign the result back to a

counter=6
until [ $counter -lt 3 ]; do
  let counter-=1
  echo $counter
done
```


### Positional Parameters
```bash
# We can access command line arguments using $1, $2, $3...$N variables in bash scripts
# print the first and the third arguments if they exist
echo $1 $3

# run ./your_script.bash arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4
# you shall get 'arg1 arg3' in your terminal

# print the number of arguments 
echo $#

# print all arguments
echo $*

```

### Assignments
Write a script to create a new file.


- If this file already exists, print `File already exists`
  - Sample output: `File already exists`  
- If this file does not exist, create it and write current date into it. Display all contents in current directory.
  - Sample output: `Creating New File xxx...`
  - Sample output: `File Created Successfully!`
  - Sample output: `Wed Feb 24 14:40:28 CST 2021`

- Hint:
  - `ls` - list information of files in current directory
  - `[ -f FILE]` - True if FILE exists and is a regular file.

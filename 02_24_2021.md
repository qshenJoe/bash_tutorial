### Variables
```bash
# The link under the code block explains what the comment below means: 
#!/bin/bash

# We declared a variable username and assign a string value 'Vivian' to it
# You can name your own variable and try to assign any string value to it
  
username="Vivian"

# We declared a variable age and assign a integer value 25 to it

age=25

# Suppose you want to display the variable or any other value in the terminal,
# you can try the following command

# display a string

echo "Good afternoon, Vivian"

# display a string with a variable
# With this command, you can reference your predeclared variable by its name with a $ sign prefixed to it 

echo "Good afternoon, $username"

# You can try to assign a value derived from a command to a variable and display it

username=$(whoami)
echo $username

currentdate=$(date)
echo $currentdate

# You can combine your variable with some values, for instance:
# The following command gives you the current year
# This is called parameter expansion

year=$(date +%Y)
newyear=${year}_this_is_a_tail
echo $newyear

### Numeric and String Comparisons
|Description|Numeric Comparison|String Comparison|
|-----|-----|-----|
|less than|-lt|<|
|greater than|-gt|>|
|equal|-eq|=|
|not equal|-ne|!=|
|less or equal|-le|N/A|
|greater or equal|-ge|N/A|
|Shell comparison example|[100 eq 50]; echo $?|["Vivian" = "Rabbit"]; echo $?|

We use square brackets `[]` to perform evaluation of numeric and string comparisons.


Using `echo $?` to check the returned value from the previously executed evaluation.


There are two possible outcomes for every evaluation, `true` or `false`.


If the returned value is equal to `0`, then the comparison evaluation is `true`.
If the returned value is equal to `1`, then the comparison evaluation is `false`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

string_a="Vivian"
string_b="Rabbit"

echo "Is $string_a a $string_b?"
[ $string_a = $string_b ]
echo $?

# notice
# [ $string_a = $string_b ] works
# [ $string_a=$string_b ] works
# [$string_a = $string_b] won't work

num_a=50
num_b=100
echo "Is $num_a less than $num_b?"
[ $num_a -lt $num_b ]
echo $?
```

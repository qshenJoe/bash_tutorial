There were a few unforgetable experiences when upgrading systems for out customers.
When upgrading system for PPG, the upgrade failed at first time because the disk of customer's server was full.
Later on they extended  their disk's capacity and the upgrade was carried on and succeeded in the end. 
After the support, I gave feedback to our dev-team and they updated the pre-check script to avoid such kind of problems for future upgrades.
Another support took our three days to upgrade system for BNPP, in which I learned a lot and realized there were still quite a few problems to be solved in the upcoming days.

I've got a few expectations of myself in the next year. Firstly, I would like to keep working on coming up with test cases of better test coverage.
Additionally, I will practise myself to provide more professional support for our customers either when dealing with support tickets or on Webex.
